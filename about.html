<span> 
I’m a second-year PhD Student at NYU’s Center for Cyber Security (CCS) under
the guidance of Prof. Cappos. Throughout my career, my interests have ranged
from binary analysis, cryptography, Operating Systems, and Security-oriented
software engineering. My goal is to elucidate software solutions that improve
security and privacy for all computer users.

My current research focuses on securing the software development life-cycle.
Before that, my research focused on secure password storage mechanisms and
update systems. Because of this, I’m the team lead of in-toto, a framework to
secure the software development life-cycle, as well as PolyPasswordHasher, a
password storage mechanism that’s incredibly resilient to offline password
cracking. Also, I’m a contributor for The Update Framework (TUF), which is the
software update system being integrated on a variety of projects like Docker,
CPAN, and others.

In my free time, I like developing open source software, including mobile
applications for education and a custom [desktop-background daemon](https://github.com/santiagotorres/bg_daemon) that crawls
Reddit/Imgur. I tend towards writing small, yet usable applications on my own
and publishing them (usually as proofs of concept) on [GitHub](https://github.com/santiagotorres). I’m also a member
of the [Arch Linux Security Team](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_CVE_Monitoring_Team), and have contributed small patches to
other medium to big-sized F/OSS projects. You can read more about the projects
I contributed to in my project-list page.

When I’m not coding, I enjoy playing Guitar (I like playing Progressive rock,
Jazz and Math-rock) and reading pretty much about anything.
